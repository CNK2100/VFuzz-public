> [Vulnerability description]

Z-Wave Unauthenticated  devices with chipset 500 series  are vulnerable to command injection vulnerability,
which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to send arbitrary packets to  a vulnerable device. 
By sending a specially-crafted Z-Wave packet to a vulnerable device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker 
may be able to totally control the device and  cause denial of service. Moreover, exploitation of 
this vulnerability can enable a  Man-in-the-middle attacker to  sniff the Z-Wave network traffic and 
replay it back successfully to the vulnerable device. Affected products include Unauthenticated  
Z-Wave smart home devices with chipset 500. This vulnerability is due to the missing encryption (CWE-311) 
implementation in the chipset. This vulnerability can be optionally fixed by Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware upgrade 
on devices that supports OTA .  To protect against this vulnerability on device that do not support OTA,  
consumers should upgrade to Authenticated 500 or 700 chipsets that support Security 2 (S2) encryption.

> [Additional Information]

With the use of tools and transceivers that can decode Z-Wave frame( e.g., Scapy-radio with HackRF One;
Yard Stick One; RFCat ; RTL-SDR; Zniffer with Sigma UZB) an attacker sniffs and captures any Z-Wave 
communication of a target Z-Wave smart home. Then he retrieves the Z-Wave HomeID and NodeID of devices 
that are transmiting packets in the network. With the knowledge of the HomeID, the attacker can brute force 
the Z-Wave network to know all remaining available smart devices in the network. This is achieved by sending
to all possible Z-Wave node (2 to 232) either these Z-Wave frames: No Operation (NOP), SWITCH_BINARY_GET,
or Node Information (NIF) to get the acknowledgement (ACK) from non-authenticated devices. 
For authenticated devices the attacker will send Node Information (NIF), SECURITY_NONCE_GET, 
and SECURITY_2_NONCE_GET. From this ACK the attacker retrieves the node ID of devices that responded and 
their NIF capabilities. With the knowledge of the Z-Wave HomeID, NIF, and NodeID of the device, 
the attacker crafts a Z-Wave packet with a desired command as payload and sends it to the target device 
by using a customized Z-Wave packet management software and  HackRF One, or  Yard Stick One,  RFCat, or CC1110. 
The device will accept and validate the packet.

> [How does an attacker exploit this vulnerability ?]

Attacker and target device need to be within a range of 30 meters. 
The range can be increased by using an advanced Software-Defined Radio (SDR) hardware.
------------------------------------------

> [What is the impact of this vulnerability ?]

 Total control of the device and DoS.
